or you can clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/DavidPrichard/Simple-Python-Website/.git`

## Running

If you don't already have Python, you will need to [download it](https://www.python.org/downloads/). The project was written for Python 2.7.11, but it currently runs in 3.5 as well.

Once you have Python, run **\_\_main\_\_.py**. It should generate **fresh_tomatoes.html** and open it in your browser automatically. If you are lazy you can also view the latest version [here](davidprichard.github.io/Simple-Python-Website/fresh_tomatoes.html)
