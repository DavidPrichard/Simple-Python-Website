# Simple-Python-Website
A set of Python modules that create a simple webpage. Written as a project for the Udacity full-stack web developer nanodegree.

## Download

You can download the latest version [here](https://github.com/DavidPrichard/Simple-Python-Website/archive/master.zip),  

or clone the repo:
`git clone https://github.com/DavidPrichard/Simple-Python-Website/.git`

## Run it

If you don't already have Python, you will need to [download it](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and run the installer;
I wrote the project in Python 2.7.11, so that is guaranteed to work.

Once you have Python, run `fresh_tomatoes.py` by opening it with the Python Launcher;
it should generate `fresh_tomatoes.html` and open it in your browser automatically.

Alternatively, you can run it from the shell with the command `python path/to/directory/fresh_tomatoes.py`

If you are lazy, you can also view the latest output directly [here](http://davidprichard.github.io/Simple-Python-Website/fresh_tomatoes.html).
